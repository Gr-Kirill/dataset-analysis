**Find the answer to the questions posed**

*Using the dataset "datasets/set.csv"*

**Task_1**
Divide the users of the application into age groups with an interval of 5 years (for example, a group of users (20-25] years old).
Select among them the age group that has become the most active (in absolute terms) in the storis reposts.
In the response, reflect the age range, as well as the number of story reposts.

**Task_2**
Who likes stories more often: users who are located inside the country (inside_country), or users outside it (outside_country)?
In the answer, specify who likes more often, and also specify the share of likes from the total number of stories shown for this group (round the percentages to thousandths).

**Task_3**
Name the short name of the story (name field) that showed the highest conversion to the "favorite" category (i.e. it was added to bookmarks by users - favorite_tap_flg). When choosing, analyze only those stories that have been shown more than 100 times.

**Task_4**
Find the name of the story in which, depending on the region, the spread of the share of views is the maximum and output these top three such regions.

**Task_5**
* Build a distribution of customers based on age, device type and operating system type
